In this repository I've added my taks that I am done so far during my first 2 days of the internship at codsoft.
----------------------------------------------Task 1------------------------------------------------
                                -------Number Guessing Game----------
The program is a simple number guessing game that ask the user to add number of attempts they want,
and guess a number between 1 and 100 within the number of attempts.
After each attempt the program displays the number of attempts left for the user
and the condition whether the number entered is above or below the random number .

When the user enters the correct number it displays a message 
and the number of attempts they took to guess the number, 
then it asks the user if they want to continue and replay the game with a new number 

The program has a main menu of three selections :
1-Enter the game : the game will start and the program will generate a random number .
2-View Score : to display the score ( 20 points for each win ) and the number of won rounds .
3-Quit : it asks the user if they really want to exit and displays a goodbye message.
